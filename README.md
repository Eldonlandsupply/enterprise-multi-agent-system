# Enterprise Multi-Agent System for Microsoft Ecosystem

Welcome to the **Enterprise Multi-Agent System** repository.  This project contains the high-level design and detailed specification for a multi-agent AI/automation solution built entirely on Microsoft Azure, Power Platform and Microsoft 365.  The goal of this system is to orchestrate multiple autonomous agents to handle complex workflows across departments while respecting enterprise governance and security requirements.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- A **master inventory** of all agents required to implement the solution.  Each agent is given a unique identifier and a concise description of its type, role, triggers and dependencies.
- **Per-agent deep dives** describing the responsibilities, tasks, integrations, triggers, error handling and security requirements for each agent.  These documents provide implementation-ready specifications for developers and power users.
- A step-by-step **installation & configuration framework** that covers prerequisite setup, resource provisioning, identity and security configuration, agent deployment, CI/CD integration, monitoring, testing and future extension patterns.
- **Runtime interaction flows** that illustrate webhook intake, queue/backoff handling, caching decisions and alerting signals across the agents.  See `docs/architecture.md` for the diagrams.

Refer to the `docs/` directory for detailed specifications and guidance.

## Architecture & Extension Notes

- Read `docs/architecture.md` for an end-to-end view of how the session manager, API client and agents collaborate, including example interaction flows and extension guidance.
- Each agent has a deep dive under `docs/agents/`, and the master inventory lives in `docs/master_inventory.md`.

## GitHub Integration

- Use feature branches off `main` (e.g., `feature/<agent-id>`). Submit pull requests with linked issues so changes are traceable to business requirements.
- Protect `main` with required checks: documentation linting if available, CI for agent code (Functions, ML, Logic Apps definitions) and integration smoke tests.
- Store secrets for agent endpoints in GitHub Actions secrets (never in workflows). Grant least privilege for deployment identities and rotate credentials on a schedule.
- Use PR templates to capture deployment notes, observability changes and rollback steps. Tag stakeholders (security, data, operations) for reviews when agent contracts change.
Additional planning resources:

- `docs/framework-survey.md` – survey of orchestration frameworks, their fit with provider abstraction, and queue-aligned integration options.
## GitHub Integration

See `docs/github-webhook-integration.md` for the webhook-first ingestion plan, including signature verification, event routing, retry expectations, and migration steps from polling to webhooks.
