# Enterprise Multi-Agent System for Microsoft Ecosystem

Welcome to the **Enterprise Multi-Agent System** repository.  This project contains the high-level design and detailed specification for a multi-agent AI/automation solution built entirely on Microsoft Azure, Power Platform and Microsoft 365.  The goal of this system is to orchestrate multiple autonomous agents to handle complex workflows across departments while respecting enterprise governance and security requirements.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- A **master inventory** of all agents required to implement the solution.  Each agent is given a unique identifier and a concise description of its type, role, triggers and dependencies.
- **Per-agent deep dives** describing the responsibilities, tasks, integrations, triggers, error handling and security requirements for each agent.  These documents provide implementation-ready specifications for developers and power users.
- A step-by-step **installation & configuration framework** that covers prerequisite setup, resource provisioning, identity and security configuration, agent deployment, CI/CD integration, monitoring, testing and future extension patterns.

Refer to the `docs/` directory for detailed specifications and guidance.

Additional planning resources:

- `docs/framework-survey.md` – survey of orchestration frameworks, their fit with provider abstraction, and queue-aligned integration options.
